Note: Unit tests will be pulled here, while library updates will be pulled
into [imageproc-lib]
(https://github.com/biomimetics/imageproc-lib/tree/imageproc2.5-integration).

This is the board support integration branch for ImageProc 2.5 unit tests.
Please send pull requests with unit tests here.

Use the following commands to setup the integration branch in your local git
repository. These commands assume you have forked imageproc-test from
biomimetics into your Github account, and then cloned your Github fork into
your local repository.

After following these instructions, "push" will always push changes to your
fork of the integration branch on your Github account, while "pull" will
always pull the most recent changes from the central integration branch.

In Git Bash:
```bash
git remote add -t imageproc2.5-integration imageproc2.5-integration git@github.com:biomimetics/imageproc-test.git
git fetch imageproc2.5-integration
git checkout -b imageproc2.5-integration -t imageproc2.5-integration/imageproc2.5-integration
git push origin imageproc2.5-integration
git remote set-url --push imageproc2.5-integration `git config remote.origin.url`
```
